# Manifold
## Manifold will help people who own things manage the things they own
### cards and apps
Each thing you own is visible in the UX as a card into which you can install apps. 

#### Safe & Mine
The default app is called "Safe & Mine" and lets you choose a message which will be seen by someone who finds the thing when misplaced/lost. The finder will scan the QR Code tag attached to your thing to see your message. Your message will invite the finder to contact you to arrange for you and your thing to be reunited.

#### other apps
We plan for a community of third party app developers who will produce apps for Manifold things.

## Business
We call our customers "owners" who will be drawn from the population of people who own things.

Manifold is under production by students working in [Pico Labs](http://picolabs.io).

(so far, four students have worked on it, spending about as much time as we have in this class (not counting the time they spent learning the software toolset))

Since Pico Labs is not-for-profit, and open-source, there will be no attempt to monetize Manifold.

Third party app developers may adopt a for-profit model, with their apps available for purchase.

## Legal
Manifold includes a privacy policy, but has no end-user license agreement (EULA) nor service level agreement (SLA).

Since it is open source, others may clone or fork and establish their own policies and agreements.

The open source does not currently have a license, but we reserve the right to select one in the future.


## Technical
Manifold code will be available in a [public repository](https://github.com/Picolab/Manifold).

Manifold is a single page application implemented in React with Bootstrap styling. It uses picos as its DBMS.

## How to join Manifold development
To join the Manifold development team informally, make a pull request in the repo.

Employment opportunities are available for full-time BYU students.
